                  The client had a clear problematic, the automation of an approval process throught multiple directions.<br>
                I took care of the design of the application and suggested elements helping out to improve the visibility's process for the end user.<br>
                The app was designed using Power apps and its functionalities were developped with SPFX.<br>
                The automation of the approval, review and refusal was created with Power Automate, the whole process' flow had to be translated with logical steps to implement.</p>

                    An AI that could help researchers analyse papers out of their fields of expertise, extracts relevant insights, and interprets the solution in the researcher's own field.<br>
                    I applied the OpenAI API to harness GPT’s knowledge for extracting and transferring insights across domains. <br>
                    Thus, throught Python scripts, I Developed a prototype AI agent designed to support researchers by identifying innovative solutions and insights.<br>

                    I participated in my first 3-day game jam with the general theme Spring. At the start of the event, the specific theme Butterfly was announced.<br>
                    To create a presentable game within such a short timeframe, I designed the E-Click System, inspired by the balance of a simple natural ecosystem with four core elements.<br>
                    The gameplay incorporated the butterfly effect: players could “click” on elements to generate various outcomes. <br>
                    However, without understanding the hidden natural rules I programmed in C++ and C#, the system could eventually collapse... unless the player discovered how to maintain balance.<br>
                    In just three days, I developed the gameplay system, coded the mechanics, composed the music, and created the artwork. The game ranked #50 among all submissions.<br>
